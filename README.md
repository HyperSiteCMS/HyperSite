# HyperSite
Web-based content management system for building websites.

Similar to Joomla, Wordpress and other content management systms, HyperSite is built from scratch providing it's own template system and class management.

By default, HyperSite includes:
- Page Management - Add pages via admin panel
- Member System - Allow members to sign up to your site (User registration is disabled by default, only admin account is default for allowing modification)
- BBCode Implementation - Allow BBCode for displaying on page. Will then be allowed use on all other modules by default.

All other features will be modular. Current modules in development:
- Forum system (Planning Stage)
- Shoutbox (Planning Stage)
- Store (Planning stage)
- Blog (Planning Stage)

Any other ideas welcome. Users will also be able to create modules for this.
