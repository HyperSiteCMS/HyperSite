# HyperSite
Web-based content management system for building websites.

Similar to Joomla, Wordpress and other content management systms, HyperSite is built from scratch providing it's own template system and class management.

By default, HyperSite includes:
- Page Management - Add pages via admin panel
- Member System - Allow members to sign up to your site (User registration is disabled by default, only admin account is default for allowing modification)
- Fully Modular - Admins can load and enable/disable modules at will. No file modification will ever be necessary to install modules.

All other features will be modular. Current modules in development (Released in this order):
- Blog - Turn your website into a blog (Planning)
- Forum - Create a community for your users (Planning). N.B. This module will automatically enable users to register and login.
- Download Centre - Allow admins (and possibly users) to submit files for downloading. (Planning. Will be released on HS before release)
- Web Store - Turn your website into a business (Idea)
- Shoutbox - Basic chat system (Idea)

Any other ideas welcome. Users will also be able to create modules for this.
